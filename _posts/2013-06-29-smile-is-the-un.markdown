<blockquote>Smile is the unspoken language of Joy ! Keep smiling :)</blockquote>


Many would wonder from where I got this quote from. I had neither googled to find this nor I would like to. I found this quote in a Pharmaceutical company's brochure and from then it has become one of my favourite.

Sometime I could feel that if my face is tight, my heart also gets tighter and vice versa. This is not a new phenomenon though :)

Smiling keeps your face,heart and your life lighter and joyous !

Keep smiling :)
