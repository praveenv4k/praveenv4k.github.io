Hi folks,

My sunday started off with a nice filter coffee and couple of slices of bread. These days I am trying to clean my home during the weekends which I actually didn't do regularly till now. So I had to put a lot of efforts for it. I had to collect the information about what are the gadgets I need to clean the home. And while doing so I also wanted to find cheap stores near my home from where I can get those stuff.

Given that I am in Japan for quite some time in fact a very long time ( 4 years now) I already had some idea of cheap stores here. My favourite of all is OK stores ([http://www.ok-corporation.co.jp](http://www.ok-corporation.co.jp)) which has been my lifeline all these days. The most interesting thing (sometimes weird also) in Japanese super markets is that exactly same item will be sold in different prices depending on the stores. Sometimes these differences would go beyond 100 yen. And you could not find a single supermarket where you can get all the items for cheaper prices.

Coming back to the point, for cleaning my home,my floor especially I had buy a Mop, some wet tissues, stain cleaner liquid and some cloth pieces. I went to my favourite store to find these stuff where I could find all these stuff but I was not convinced with the price of the items. So I hit the  famous 100 yen (like dollar shops) shops near my home. Here you can find almost all the items you need for 100 yen(105 yen inclusive of consumption tax. Consumption taxes will be reaching 8% and then 10% in the next three years in Japan). So I could pick the mop,wet tissues and waste clothes here and I spend around 315 yen on them.Pretty cheap right! But the word of caution I would not suggest anyone to buy food stuff from 100 yen shops because for some reason I feel that the quality is not so good.

And then I had to find a floor cleaning liquid. There were lot of liquids, wax coatings sold in OK store. But I was not sure which one to go. I am good japanese speaker but not great in reading. I didn't want to annoy the shop person by asking too many questions. So the next day I asked my colleague Mr.Matsumoto and he suggested me to go for [Rinrei All Cleaner](http://www.rinrei.co.jp/home_care/category/item/floor_resinwax/item_01.html). He suggested me to buy in [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.jp/s?ie=UTF8&field-keywords=リンレイ&index=hpc-jp&search-type=ss) but once again looking up there I was not convinced by the price. So I decided to go to another shop near my home called [Espot](http://www.makiya-group.co.jp/espot/). This is a very huge shop with almost all you need to live. Fortunately I could find the same cleaner for about 350 yen which is the cheapest of all stores. And today I am using all these gadgets to clean my home and yeah it is a tiresome job :(

So my picks are

1. OK stores to get you daily needs especially food stuff(bread,milk and other cooking stuff)

2. Vegetables - Buy from exclusive vegetable stores where they will be cheaper and fresh.

3. 100 yen shops for stationery items

4. Espot for home needs like cleaning stuff (don't buy frozen stuff from here)

5. 7-Eleven - Omnipresent, Lifeline but bit expensive

5. Others

And these picks are based on the stores near my home in [Isehara, Japan](https://maps.google.co.jp/maps?client=safari&q=google+maps+isehara&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x6019aa1a02d68029:0x5fc0144a0c218067,Isehara,+Kanagawa+Prefecture&gl=jp&ei=GaPPUY3CIsmekwXRmoCYAw&ved=0CCcQ8gEwAA). And it may differ based on where you are located in Japan.

Okay folks

Happy sunday :)
