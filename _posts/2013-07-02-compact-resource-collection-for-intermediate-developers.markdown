In this post I would like to register my observations about the programming resource I found recently. Before starting to speak about it, let me speak about the background which made me search for such resources. I have been using PC for quite sometime and I always wanted to buy a Mac which I did couple of months ago when I bought [Mac book Pro](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/). Why I chose Mac book Pro over retina model is a different discussion. And the reason behind buying a Mac is that I wanted to learn [iOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS) application development. From the Windows background have worked for sometime in Win32, MFC, Forms and [WPF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation) application mainly using C++,[C#.NET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29) languages I always wondered how [UI programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface) is done in Apple powered devices. So now the discussion converges close to the title of the post.

I started searching for the beginners guide for getting started with [XCode](http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/) and iOS programming. Though Apple provides extensive reference manuals for its development tools and also [Objective-C](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/navigation/) Programming, it would be a nighmare to even think of reading it completely before beginning to play with the XCode and Obj-C. Coming from C++,C# background I had the understanding of OOP concepts so I just wanted to understand how things are done differently in Obj-C. All these requirements made me search for a compact guide which can give a better overview of Xcode,Obj-C and iOS programming. One such resource I found recently is from User interface controls provider [SyncFusion](http://www.syncfusion.com?UTM_medium=praveenblog). They offer a nice collection of compact developer resources called the [succinctly series](http://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/ebooks?UTM_medium=praveenblog). I found [Objective-C Succinctly](http://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/ebooks/objective-c?UTM_medium=praveenblog)Â and [iOS succinctly](http://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/ebooks/ios?UTM_medium=praveenblog). These guides provided exactly what I wanted in terms of getting started with the iOS programming. The content of the book is not too less to leave anything or not too extensive to cover everything. It is compact with example snippets wherever necessary. You can go through them quickly and after you finish reading these books you would be having a better idea of iOS programming. This is a good starting point and kudos to SyncFusion for giving back to the developer community wonderful resources like this. I have become a fan of Succinctly series and I am also looking forward to go through Typescript succinctly and [Windows Store apps](http://windows.microsoft.com) succinctly.

Time to sleep !

Ciao !!!
