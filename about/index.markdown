Hi there,

This is PraveenKumar Vasudevan. I am from a lovely, ancient city called Madurai which is in the southern state of Tamil Nadu in India.

I love my family, I speak a lot and I have opinions about everything which I come to know.

I am a technology hobbyist and I love everything starting from diode, micro controller, c++, Robotics, .NET, Html5, Sencha Touch, Obj-c, ORM, Entity framework, Sqlite and it goes on...

I am a spiritual guy and follows vegetarianism.

I speak Tamil, English and Japanese. Looking forward to learn Italian and French in coming years.

Praveen
